                    "question": "What is SigFixes?",
                    "answer": "SigFixes is a performance patch for the Sigmally client. It swaps the rendering engine for a WebGL canvas, making gameplay smoother, faster, and more responsive—especially useful for multiboxing and competitive play."

                {
                    "question": "Does SigFixes change how the game looks?",
                    "answer": "By default, it looks just like the original client. But for advanced users, it adds options like skin overrides, cell opacity adjustments, text scaling, glow effects, and outlines for unsplittable cells."

                    "question": "Will SigFixes help with multiboxing?",
                    "answer": "Yes. It offers features like One-tab control, vision merging options, spawn blocking, and tab outlines—all designed to reduce input delay and improve sync between tabs."

                {
                    "question": "How do I install SigFixes?",

                {
                    "question": "What is the 'draw delay' setting?",
                    "answer": "Draw delay controls how often the game canvas refreshes. Higher values make animations smoother but may lower performance; lower values boost performance but can make visuals less fluid. You can customize it to your preference."
